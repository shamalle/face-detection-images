# face-detection-images

In this project, a convolutional neural network (CNN) is implemented and trained for binary classification of image patches of faces and non-faces (with the help of data sets containing image patches of faces and backgrounds/non-faces.

Because of the model being fully convolutional (no fixed size inputs of layers) it can be used on bigger images and get a spatial map of face scores for different image patches (face recognition).
